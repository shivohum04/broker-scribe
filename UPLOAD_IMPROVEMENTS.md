# Media Upload Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the media upload functionality to ensure reliable operation on mobile devices.

## Key Improvements

### 1. File Validation

- **File Size Limit**: Maximum 50MB per file
- **Video Duration Limit**: Maximum 30 seconds for videos
- **File Type Validation**: Only images and videos are allowed
- **Client-side validation** before upload to provide immediate feedback

### 2. File Compression

- **Image Compression**: Uses `browser-image-compression` library
  - Reduces file size while maintaining quality
  - Maximum 2MB output size
  - Maximum 1920px width/height
- **Video Compression**: Uses `ffmpeg.wasm` for client-side video processing
  - Compresses videos larger than 10MB
  - Reduces resolution to max 720p
  - Optimizes for web delivery

### 3. Enhanced Upload Service

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- **Proper Content Types**: Explicitly sets MIME types in Supabase upload
- **Cache Control**: Sets appropriate cache headers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and user-friendly messages

### 4. Better Error Handling

- **Detailed Logging**: Captures full error context including:
  - File metadata (size, type, name)
  - User agent and browser info
  - Timestamp and upload context
  - Supabase error details
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Converts technical errors to actionable messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress and status

### 5. Mobile-Optimized UI

- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for each upload step
- **Status Icons**: Clear success/error indicators
- **File Information**: Shows file size and duration limits
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "browser-image-compression": "^2.0.2",
  "@ffmpeg/ffmpeg": "^0.12.10",
  "@ffmpeg/util": "^0.12.1"
}
```

### Key Files Modified

- `src/lib/upload-utils.ts` - New utility functions for validation and compression
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Enhanced upload service with retry logic
- `src/components/MediaUpload.tsx` - Improved UI with progress tracking

### Upload Flow

1. **File Selection**: User selects files via file input
2. **Validation**: Check file size, type, and video duration
3. **Processing**: Compress images/videos if needed
4. **Upload**: Upload with retry logic and progress tracking
5. **Completion**: Update UI with results and error handling

## Testing Recommendations

### Mobile Testing

- Test on Android Chrome and iPhone Safari
- Try various file sizes (small, medium, large)
- Test different video formats (MP4, MOV, WebM)
- Test with slow network connections
- Verify compression works correctly

### Error Scenarios

- Upload files larger than 50MB
- Upload videos longer than 30 seconds
- Test with poor network connectivity
- Try uploading unsupported file types

### Performance Testing

- Monitor upload times for different file sizes
- Check compression effectiveness
- Verify retry logic works correctly
- Test concurrent uploads

## Configuration

### File Size Limits

```typescript
export const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB
export const MAX_VIDEO_DURATION = 30; // 30 seconds
```

### Retry Configuration

```typescript
export const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
export const RETRY_DELAY_BASE = 1000; // 1 second base delay
```

### Compression Settings

- **Images**: Max 2MB, max 1920px dimension
- **Videos**: Max 720p, CRF 28 quality setting

## Error Logging

All upload errors are logged with comprehensive context:

- File metadata
- User environment
- Error details
- Timestamp

Logs are sent to console and can be integrated with services like Sentry or LogRocket.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for all features
- **Mobile Browsers**: Optimized for mobile upload experience
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Future Enhancements

- **Chunked Uploads**: For very large files
- **Resume Uploads**: Continue interrupted uploads
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in parallel
- **Advanced Compression**: More compression options
- **Upload Analytics**: Track upload success rates and performance
